# TODO

1. Create a dynamic model configurator.
2. Move agent prompt to file referenced by cliarg for quicker iteration on prompt modifications.
3. Improve system prompt so the model handles tasks it doesn't understand better.
4. Create a system that grabs tool descriptions and injects them into the system prompt dynamically.
5. Create a more realistic data-driven tool test against a real API endpoint.
